# To run MINERVA 2's memory retrieval process in ITS.R simply give it a list of words as strings,
# separated by commas, for example:
# probe <- c("this","is","how","you","format","a","probe","for","MINERVA")

# To run Kwantes' modification to MINERVA 2, whose activation value is the product of all
# activations:
# probe <- c("this is", "how you", "format a probe", "for MINERVA")
